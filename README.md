# Iris-data-casestudy
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald
Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and
Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and
the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

I have used various python,numpy and pandas operations.
I have import all the necessary modules from sklearn.
In this project I explained how to create model, how to do tunning for model to increase the accuracy.
Some boosting ang bagging techiniques are used ,again to increase the accuracy and to avoid overfitting of model.

Conclusion:
I have done this Iris Data set analysis for future prediction of species. If any new sample of flower
came for identification this project will help to understand which species it belongs to.
